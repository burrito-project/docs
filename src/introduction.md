# Introduction

Contigo Burrito is a project that aims to achieve real-time tracking of the UNMMS internal
transport bus (*or buses!*) to make students' lives easier, as well as:

- In-app notifications in the form of banners, popups and posts.
- Real-time tracking of the bus location, status and device battery.
- App versioning and forcing client updates.
- Bus stops and route information, including the distance to the next stop.
- User sessions (for analytics) and authentication (for protected resources).
- Feature flags for both server and clients.
- Multimedia upload integration with [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

The following document contains all the technical high-level documentation of the project,
including development setup, compilation, distribution, deployment, and other relevant
